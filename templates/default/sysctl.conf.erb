# arp_announce - INTEGER
# Define different restriction levels for announcing the local source IP
# address from IP packets in ARP requests sent on interface:
#
# * **0** - (default) Use any local address, configured on any interface
# * **1** - Try to avoid local addresses that are not in the target's subnet
#           for this interface. This mode is useful when target hosts reachable
#           via this interface require the source IP address in ARP requests to
#           be part of their logical network configured on the receiving
#           interface. When we generate the request we will check all our
#           subnets that include the target IP and will preserve the source
#           address if it is from such subnet. If there is no such subnet we
#           select source address according to the rules for level 2.
# * **2** - Always use the best local address for this target. In this mode
#           we ignore the source address in the IP packet and try to select
#           local address that we prefer for talks with the target host. Such
#           local address is selected by looking for primary IP addresses on
#           all our subnets on the outgoing interface that include the target
#           IP address. If no suitable local address is found we select the
#           first local address we have on the outgoing interface or on all
#           other interfaces, with the hope we will receive reply for our
#           request and even sometimes no matter the source IP address we

# * **3** - do not reply for local addresses configured with scope host, only
